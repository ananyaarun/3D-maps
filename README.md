# Open Street Maps
This repository contains some interesting and useful ideas along with a map prototype for creting reusable and configurable maps.

## 1) 3D buildings
  Allows the user to display buildings in 3D format in a certin area of a map.Can be used to show the opulation density of a    perticular place or region.
  
## 2) Animating a point
  This allows a user to animate a point to move accross the map. Can be used to trace routes from a perticular place to another and diplay them visually on a map.
  
## 3) Changing languages in a map
   This allows the user to configure a map to the language of their choice.I have shown in the above map 4 arbitrary languages and how the user can ghange betwen them.
   
## 4) geojson polygon
   This allows to display a set of geojson points a s a polygon. Can be useful if we want to highlight a certain region on the map.
   
## 5) Showing and Hinding layers
   This allows the user to show and hide multiple layers of a map.In the above map i have created 2 layers for example and the user can choose to display none of them,either one of them or both of them.
