# Open Street Maps - additional ideas
This repository contains some interesting and useful ideas for configurable maps. Some ideas are just interesting map applications to help understand the underlying API while some of the ideas are a logical continuation of the set of ideas I had proposed for Outreachy HOTOSM project for visualizing a configurable map

## 1) 3D buildings
  Allows the user to display buildings in 3D format in a certain area of a map. Can be used to show the population density of a    particular place or region.

## 2) Animating a point
  This allows a user to animate a point to move across the map. Can be used to trace routes from a particular place to another and display them visually on a map.

## 3) Changing languages in a map
   This allows the user to configure a map to the language of their choice. I have shown in the above map 4 arbitrary languages and how the user can change between them.

## 4) Geojson polygon
   This allows us to display a set of geojson points as a polygon. Can be useful if we want to highlight a certain region on the map.

## 5) Showing and Hiding layers
   This allows the user to show and hide multiple layers of a map. In this map I have created 2 layers and the user can choose to display none of them, either one of them or both of them.
